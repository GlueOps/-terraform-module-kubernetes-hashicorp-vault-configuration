# terraform-module-kubernetes-hashicorp-vault-configuration

This terraform module is to help you configure a vault cluster for use with OIDC Authentication and KV Secrets Engine Version 2. This module is part of the opionated GlueOps Platform. If you came here directly then you should probably visit https://github.com/glueops/admiral as that is the starting point.

## Prerequisites

- You need an unsealed vault cluster.
- You need an OIDC client secret that matches what you defined in your deployment of the Platform helm chart (`dex.vault.client_secret`)
- You need a connection to the vault cluster using `kubctl` port forwarding.
- You need to ignore self-signed SSL errors
- A json file called `../vault_access.json` needs to exist relative to the usage of this configuration module. If you ran the vault-initialization properly this file will have been created then.
